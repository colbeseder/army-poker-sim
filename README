Army Poker Sim
==============

In the army in 2023, we played a game that we (incorrectly) call "_Chinese Poker_".

During those games, several questions arose. This project aims to anser those questions, by simulating larget numbers of random games.

Questions
---------

1. How much does luck play a factor? (vs ideal strategy)
2. Is it better to focus on grouping, or flush/straight?
3. Is a _flush_ unfairly weighted?

Answers (preliminary)
---------------------

    1. How much does luck play a factor?

We see that the current top strategy _preferGroupFlushStraight_ beats _chooseLeft_ (basically random) 93% of the time. So strategy clearly matters.

But once we exclude strategyless players, we see that the best score is only 63% (_preferGroupFlushStraight_ vs _preferStraightFlushGroup_). So even a better player will still lose roughly one third of all games, to a reasonably competent opponent.

    2. Is it better to focus on grouping, or flush/straight?

At this stage, it seems that prioritising groupings (eg. pairs, three of a kind, etc) is a better strategy. Even players who completely ignore opportunities for flush or straight beat _preferFlushStraightGroup_

This may change as more advanced strtegies take more notice of which cards are still in the deck.

    3. Is a _flush_ unfairly weighted?

This remains an open question
