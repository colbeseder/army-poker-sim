Army Poker Sim
==============

In the army in 2023, we played a game that we (incorrectly) call "_Chinese Poker_".

During those games, several questions arose. This project aims to anser those questions, by simulating larget numbers of random games.

Questions
---------

1. How much does luck play a factor? (vs ideal strategy)
2. Is it better to focus on grouping, or flush/straight?
3. Is a _flush_ unfairly weighted?
